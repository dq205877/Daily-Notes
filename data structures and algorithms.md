​	In Java,executable statements are placed in functions,known as methods,that belong to class definitions.main method is the first method to be executed when running a Java program.Any set of statements between the braces "{" and "}" define a program block.

​	The name of a class,method,or variable in Java is called an identifier,which can be any string of characters as long as it begins with a letter and consists of lett-ers,numbers and underscore characters(can be from any written language define-d in the Unicode character set). 

**reserved words:** abstract assert boolean break byte case catch char class const co-ntinue default do double else enum extends false final finally float for goto if im-plements import instanceof int interface long native new null package private p-ublic return short static strictfp super switch synchronized this throw throws tr-ansient true try void volatile while

**Comments:** Java allows two kinds of comments: inline comments and block co-mments.

Base Types: also called primitive types.

boolean: a boolean value: true or false

char: 16-bit Unicode character

byte: 8-bit signed two's complement integer

short: 16-bit signed two's complement integer

int: 32-bit signed two's complement integer

long: 64-bit signed two's complement integer

float: 32-bit floating-point number(IEEE 754-1985)

double: 64-bit floating-point number(IEEE 754-1985)
